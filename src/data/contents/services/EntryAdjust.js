            "Your entryway is one of the first things you use every day, but it’s also a spot where small challenges can add up. Whether it’s a steep step, a high threshold, or a narrow walkway, these little obstacles can make coming and going more difficult than it needs to be. Over time, they can start to feel like a barrier, making what should be a simple routine feel unnecessarily stressful.",
