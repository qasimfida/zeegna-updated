            "Falls are more than just accidents—they’re a reality many seniors face. A slip in the bathroom or a trip over a rug can happen in an instant, and the impact can go far beyond a bruise or a broken bone. For older adults, a fall can lead to longer hospital stays, loss of mobility, or even a decline in confidence to move freely around the home.",
            "Nearly half of older adults who experience a fall aren’t able to call for help on their own. The time spent waiting can make recovery harder and, in some cases, lead to more serious complications. But it’s not just about physical harm—it’s the emotional toll, too. Falls can make someone feel as though their independence is slipping away, creating a cycle of worry for both seniors and their families.",
            "That’s why planning ahead matters. With the right support, you can stay safe, confident, and comfortable in your home."
