      "We were really worried about my dad slipping in the shower, so we decided to have grab bars and a shower bench installed. We found a contractor through Zeegna, and the whole process was seamless—quick, professional, and exactly what we needed. My dad feels so much more confident now, and it’s such a relief for us to know he’s safer. Highly recommend using Zeegna to find trusted providers!",

      "When my mom struggled to use her shower safely, we turned to Zeegna. Their home evaluation quiz gave us room-by-room recommendations, highlighting grab bars, a walk-in shower, and non-slip flooring for the bathroom. The personalized plan made prioritizing easy, and the contractor they provided was outstanding. We couldn’t be happier with the process!",

      "After my grandmother transitioned to using a wheelchair, the entryway to her home became a big obstacle. A friend referred me to Zeegna, and I’m so glad they did! They matched us with a great contractor who not only installed a ramp but also improved the lighting around the entry. The result is amazing, and my grandmother can now come and go freely. Zeegna truly simplified what felt like an overwhelming task!",
